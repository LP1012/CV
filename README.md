# Curriculum Vitae: Liam M. Pohlmann
This repository contains my CV source files.
The PDF file must be built using `pdflatex`.
Additionally, BibLaTeX is used for handling the bibliography, which requires `biber` on the backend.
A `Makefile` is included for convenience (assuming the above prerequisites are met).

Thank you for interest, and thank you to [Dr. Katy Huff](https://github.com/katyhuff/CV) for the source files from which this repository was based off of.
